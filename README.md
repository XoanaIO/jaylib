### Release Notes:
#### 2018.10.11
Raylib-Java is not yet production ready or battle hardened.  The current release, 2018.10, most closely matches a 0.0.1-alpha build.  It is available here only as proof that things are moving forward. 

### Download:

If you don't much care for warnings and scoff at the idea of heeding common sense, you can download the initial 0.0.1 release here for Windows64 machines.
